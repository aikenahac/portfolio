      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        💻 I started my software development journey at the young age of 7
        years. Since I grew up in the digital age, I was surrounded by
        technology my whole life. I had an interest in knowing how the things I
        entertain myself with daily work. From that point on, every time I used
        a website or played a game I looked into the background to try to
        understand how it was built.
      </p>

      <p>
        🌐 I soon found out I was most interested in web and mobile development,
        specifically information systems and applications like Facebook,
        YouTube, and many other popular applications. I started learning by
        trying to understand how they're built and replicating these
        applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        💼 When I came to high school I soon joined my very first startup,
        YFLab, as a web and mobile developer. I loved working in a team so I
        grew my horizons and collaborated on multiple startups in diverse teams.
        I've always preferred a leadership role, so if it was possible I
        accepted the challenge of leading a team.
      </p>

      <p>
        📚 In my spare time, I love to help others learn to program. I pass on
        my mobile development knowledge within the Vegovacraft club at my high
        school, by teaching a Flutter course available to all students visiting
        the school.

        🎙️ I host a podcast over at
        <a href="https://hell0.world" target="_blank">hell0.world</a>. We talk
        about a variety of topics, including software development, space
        exploration, science, and so much more.
